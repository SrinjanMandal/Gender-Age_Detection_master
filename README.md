# Gender-Age_Detection_master
a real‑time Python app that spots faces in webcam or image input, then predicts gender (male/female) and age bracket using lightweight CNNs (MobileNet‑V2) running on OpenCV + TensorFlow. Streamlit UI shows live video with labeled boxes and exports results to CSV, all in one plug‑and‑play repo.
